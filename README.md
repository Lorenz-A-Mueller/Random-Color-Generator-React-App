# Random Color Generator React App

On the click of the button, the app generates a random color. The user can enter a hue (red, blue, etc.) and/or pick a lightness (light or dark) before clicking the button in order to restrict possible outcomes. The width of the resulting box can also be specified in pixels. Transitions smoothly between colors.
